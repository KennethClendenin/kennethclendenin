# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenneth-clendenin/">Kenneth Clendenin's</a> IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🔐

I’m passionate about cybersecurity and thrive on solving real-world problems through hands-on projects. From hardening systems to automating remediation, I’m focused on building practical skills that reflect a strong security-first mindset.

This portfolio is just getting started — more projects are on the way. Each one is a step forward in my journey, driven by curiosity, discipline, and a commitment to doing things the right way.
